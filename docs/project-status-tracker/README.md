## 🐛 Current Issues

### Known Issues
**Total Open Issues**: 0 🎉

**Recently Resolved**:
1. ✅ **Frontend-Backend Integration** (Resolved: Sept 21, 2025)
   - Issue: TodoAPI not extracting data from response structure
   - Solution: Fixed API service layer to handle `{success, data}` format

2. ✅ **CORS Configuration** (Resolved: Sept 21, 2025)
   - Issue: Cross-origin requests blocked for port 3001
   - Solution: Updated CORS to allow both ports 3000 and 3001

3. ✅ **Express.js 5.x Routing** (Resolved: Sept 21, 2025)
   - Issue: Wildcard route pattern causing server crashes
   - Solution: Removed wildcard pattern, used proper middleware

### Technical Debt
- **Low Priority**: Consider implementing API response caching
- **Low Priority**: Add request/response logging middleware
- **Low Priority**: Implement database connection monitoring
