- Understand the flow between components/layers
- Practice explaining these flows verbally
- Draw diagrams yourself for key concepts

### 3. **Code Deep Dive**
- Read through the actual application code
- Match the documentation to real implementations
- Understand why certain patterns were chosen
- Practice explaining architectural decisions

### 4. **Interview Simulation**
- Practice answering questions out loud
- Explain concepts without looking at notes
- Use the application as examples in answers
- Focus on demonstrating practical experience

## 🚀 Next Steps
